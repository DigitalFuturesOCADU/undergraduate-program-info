Practice-based research techniques in design as ethnographic methods are explored. Research projects are used to pursue three objectives: Research to inform design deliverables, research to educate designers/researchers for future practice, and research to inform the professional design, academic, and wider communities. This course is an optional replacement for: GRPH-3012 Research Methods for GD, INDS-3002 Research Methods for ID. Students wishing to use this course as a replacement require advance permission from Chair, so that this equivalency (requiring a minimum grade of 60) can be placed on their record.

This course critically explores representations of citizen subjects who are marginalized and socially excluded through visual and discursive intersections of race, class, sexual subjectivity, and gender. Starting with colonialist and imperialist discourses of race, the course tracks the historical shaping of the global world via conquest, migration, racial politics and border crossings. We examine the theoretical and practical tensions, impacts and frameworks that media images and cultural discourses have, and what this means for questions of social justice, equality and global resistance.

This seminar course looks at how ""physically different"" bodies have been viewed artistically throughout history and in our contemporary culture. We will look at how different models of looking at ""otherness"" have pervaded our culture and how a newer, social model has finally taken root, as well as how these models affect not only our creative lives but also our social, political and personal lives, as well as the environments in which we live. By exploring different bodies as cultural representations we will be challenged to find ways in which the experience of those deemed ""different"" can be included in contemporary art, literature, and film.

This course examines methods used in the creation of new value at the intersection of behaviour and emerging technology. In the context of the creation of new experiences, spaces and products, students explore signals in technology and behaviour and identify innovative opportunities through the use of original conceptual frameworks, which include methods analyzing disruption amplification, intensification and maximization. Students develop and communicate conceptual directions for products, services or experiences through the understanding of the motivations leading to human behaviour and are exposed to methodologies supporting a culture of exploration, discovery and learning, both within team structures and their solo practice.

Embodiment is a process in which social meaning is taken into or upon the physical body. Experiences of embodiment are layered, nuanced, and multifaceted resulting in the segmenting of bodies into attributes that are gendered, racialized, disabled, aged, etc. This can contribute to a sense of fragmentation, alienation, or ""disappearance"" of the physical body as a whole. Students will investigate techniques sociologists use to explore embodiment and consciousness of the physical body using the following considerations: what embodiment replaces, how embodiment affects lived experiences, and how the physical body, despite all this, surfaces in the lived experience of social life.
