                                        <p>Light is material, and with projection technologies comes greater capacity to shape experiences of light and space. This studio-seminar class provides foundations into projection and projection mapping technologies, combining discussion of criticalcontexts and perspectives from art, architecture, film, new media, and design, with the act of developing and implementing projection-based projects. Through lectures, in-class discussions of readings, exhibition visits, and project-based assignments,students will trace the techno-cultural histories of projection/mapping and their contemporary uses and also develop an understanding of the technical considerations of projection-based art, and learn tools and techniques for projection mapping.</p>

                                        <p>This course critically explores representations of citizen subjects who are marginalized and socially excluded through visual and discursive intersections of race, class, sexual subjectivity, and gender. Starting with colonialist and imperialist discourses of race, the course tracks the historical shaping of the global world via conquest, migration, racial politics and border crossings. We examine the theoretical and practical tensions, impacts and frameworks that media images and cultural discourses have, and what this means for questions of social justice, equality and global resistance.</p>

                                        <p>This seminar course looks at how "physically different" bodies have been viewed artistically throughout history and in our contemporary culture. We will look at how different models of looking at "otherness" have pervaded our culture and how a newer, social model has finally taken root, as well as how these models affect not only our creative lives but also our social, political and personal lives, as well as the environments in which we live. By exploring different bodies as cultural representations we will be challenged to find ways in which the experience of those deemed "different" can be included in contemporary art, literature, and film.

By exploring different bodies as cultural representations we will be challenged to find ways in which the experience of those deemed "different" can be included in contemporary art, literature, and film.

                                        <p>Through critical play practices, we experiment with identity, creative expression and invention, and we learn to improvise in a system of rules. This course addresses how such forms of play can generate criticality among players. Students will explore meaning-making in play through exploration of a range of games, and by tracing a history of subversive art practices from Surrealism to contemporary game creation. Finally, the course presents diverse analytical approaches, including art history, critical theory and visual culture, to enable students to construct critical play practices. Understanding games beyond entertainment, the course seeks to foster critically-aware gamers. Students with credit in VISM-3001, VISM-3B01 may not take this course for credit.</p>

                                        <p>A game engine is a powerful development tool: enabling complex interactive experiences by providing a pre-defined structure from which to start. This course presents a critical introduction to the history, structure and craft of digital and analog game engines. It examines the affordances, mechanics, and techno-cultural histories behind a range of historic, contemporary and emerging engines and frameworks. Today's game engines are platforms on which creators build rich narratives, immersive experiences, and unique interfaces, within and beyond games. Students will gain a nuanced understanding of the ways in which game engines support and/or disrupt particular design, experiential, and cultural goals.</p>

                                        <p>Practice-based research techniques in design as ethnographic methods are explored. Research projects are used to pursue three objectives: Research to inform design deliverables, research to educate designers/researchers for future practice, and research to inform the professional design, academic, and wider communities. This course is an optional replacement for: GRPH-3012 Research Methods for GD, INDS-3002 Research Methods for ID. Students wishing to use this course as a replacement require advance permission from Chair, so that this equivalency (requiring a minimum grade of 60) can be placed on their record. Students with credit in GDES-3B68 may not take this course for credit.</p>

                                        <p>This course critically explores representations of citizen subjects who are marginalized and socially excluded through visual and discursive intersections of race, class, sexual subjectivity, and gender. Starting with colonialist and imperialist discourses of race, the course tracks the historical shaping of the global world via conquest, migration, racial politics and border crossings. We examine the theoretical and practical tensions, impacts and frameworks that media images and cultural discourses have, and what this means for questions of social justice, equality and global resistance.</p>

                                        <p>This course gives students the opportunity to develop an in-depth, self-determined project either individually or as a team. Students will develop work from a conceptual, technical, and social perspective to an advanced level by utilizing a research and development framework. Open to students from all programs, this course provides the space to investigate and create work that spans multiple disciplines through the creative use of current and future technologies. Depending on the scale of the project this course may be taken on its own or in combination with DIGF Interdisciplinary Thesis 1 for credit.</p>

                                        <p>We live in a data rich world. Today's capacity to store and access vast amounts of data increases the need for citizens, researchers, governments and business to analyze, represent, and interpret information in useful, intuitive and compelling ways. This course introduces the design process of devising visualizations, from gathering and structuring data to encoding and representing information. It focuses on the design principles and techniques used in the process of revealing patterns and relationships in the data toward effective communication of information. Students with credit in GDES-2002, GDES-2B04 may not take this course for credit.</p>

                                        <p>This seminar course looks at how "physically different" bodies have been viewed artistically throughout history and in our contemporary culture. We will look at how different models of looking at "otherness" have pervaded our culture and how a newer, social model has finally taken root, as well as how these models affect not only our creative lives but also our social, political and personal lives, as well as the environments in which we live. By exploring different bodies as cultural representations we will be challenged to find ways in which the experience of those deemed "different" can be included in contemporary art, literature, and film. Students with credit in HUMN-3B21 may not take this course for credit.</p>
