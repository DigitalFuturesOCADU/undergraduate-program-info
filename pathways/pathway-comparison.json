This course examines different models of collaboration, team formation, and communication to ensure success. It discusses the value and implications of different skill sets and problem-solving orientations over project life-cycles and group decision making. The course comprises reading discussions, small-exercises and student reflections with the aim to understanding the conditions and stages for high-functioning teams and successful projects. Note: This \"Writing Across the Curriculum\" (WAC) course is part of an initiative to support students in their disciplinary writing.",

In figurative art and body representation, tensions are evident between mainstream images and our lived experiences of embodiment. Acknowledging and questioning the problematic histories of figurative art, students examine issues of critical race theory, genders, non-binary positions, and sexuality. Discussions delve into how depictions of bodies are understood through class, abilities, beauty, abjection, post-human iterations, animal bodies, celebrity, documentary, power and performativity. Activities including critiques, studio-based experimentation, concept and prototype development, critical readings, discussion and presentations deepen understandings of this complex subject in contemporary art.",

We will look at how different models of looking at \"otherness\" have pervaded our culture and how a newer, social model has finally taken root, as well as how these models affect not only our creative lives but also our social, political and personal lives, as well as the environments in which we live. By exploring different bodies as cultural representations we will be challenged to find ways in which the experience of those deemed \"different\" can be included in contemporary art, literature, and film.

Experiences of embodiment are layered, nuanced, and multifaceted resulting in the segmenting of bodies into attributes that are gendered, racialized, disabled, aged, etc. This can contribute to a sense of fragmentation, alienation, or \"disappearance\" of the physical body as a whole. Students will investigate techniques sociologists use to explore embodiment and consciousness of the physical body using the following considerations: what embodiment replaces, how embodiment affects lived experiences, and how the physical body, despite all this, surfaces in the lived experience of social life.
