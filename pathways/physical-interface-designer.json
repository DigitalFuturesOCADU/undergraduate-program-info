          "description": "This course draws on the principles and foundations from the 1st year course: Cross-disciplinary Collaboration, as well as learner experiences of executing projects during the intervening time at OCAD U. The course supplements discussions on collaboration and team functioning and focuses on issues of leadership, conflict management, decision-making models, organizational change, and inclusivity. This is a seminar that draws on experiences of learners, as well as readings from diverse professional domains of business, sociology, cultural, and science and technology studies. The course progression will also be guided by key guest lecturers and case studies. Students with credit in DIGF-4B01 may not take this course for credit."

Research projects are used to pursue three objectives: Research to inform design deliverables, research to educate designers/researchers for future practice, and research to inform the professional design, academic, and wider communities. This course is an optional replacement for: GRPH-3012 Research Methods for GD, INDS-3002 Research Methods for ID. Students wishing to use this course as a replacement require advance permission from Chair, so that this equivalency (requiring a minimum grade of 60) can be placed on their record. Students with credit in GDES-3B68 may not take this course for credit."

          "description": "This course critically explores representations of citizen subjects who are marginalized and socially excluded through visual and discursive intersections of race, class, sexual subjectivity, and gender. Starting with colonialist and imperialist discourses of race, the course tracks the historical shaping of the global world via conquest, migration, racial politics and border crossings. We examine the theoretical and practical tensions, impacts and frameworks that media images and cultural discourses have, and what this means for questions of social justice, equality and global resistance."

Students will develop work from a conceptual, technical, and social perspective to an advanced level by utilizing a research and development framework. Open to students from all programs, this course provides the space to investigate and create work that spans multiple disciplines through the creative use of current and future technologies. Depending on the scale of the project this course may be taken on its own or in combination with DIGF Interdisciplinary Thesis 1 for credit."

          "description": "We live in a data rich world. Today's capacity to store and access vast amounts of data increases the need for citizens, researchers, governments and business to analyze, represent, and interpret information in useful, intuitive and compelling ways. This course introduces the design process of devising visualizations, from gathering and structuring data to encoding and representing information. It focuses on the design principles and techniques used in the process of revealing patterns and relationships in the data toward effective communication of information. Students with credit in GDES-2002, GDES-2B04 may not take this course for credit."

          "description": "This seminar course looks at how \"physically different\" bodies have been viewed artistically throughout history and in our contemporary culture. We will look at how different models of looking at \"otherness\" have pervaded our culture and how a newer, social model has finally taken root, as well as how these models affect not only our creative lives but also our social, political and personal lives, as well as the environments in which we live. By exploring different bodies as cultural representations we will be challenged to find ways in which the experience of those deemed \"different\" can be included in contemporary art, literature, and film. Students with credit in HUMN-3B21 may not take this course for credit."
