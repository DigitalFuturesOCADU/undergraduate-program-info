This seminar course looks at how ""physically different"" bodies have been viewed artistically throughout history and in our contemporary culture. We will look at how different models of looking at ""otherness"" have pervaded our culture and how a newer, social model has finally taken root, as well as how these models affect not only our creative lives but also our social, political and personal lives, as well as the environments in which we live. By exploring different bodies as cultural representations we will be challenged to find ways in which the experience of those deemed ""different"" can be included in contemporary art, literature, and film. Students with credit in HUMN-3B21 may not take this course for credit.
